== Persiste. API == 

The Persiste. API has three main methods which all return a response of type `LogServiceResponse`. This class has three properties:
 * Status: wich can take one of the following value:
   # error : the call was not sent to the server for reason usually specified in the message property  
   # failure : The call was well went to the server but was performed for reseon that is usually specified in the message property.
   # success : The call was performed correctly.
 * Message: The description or reason of the status 
 * Data : An option data sent from the server usualy the logs you retrieved using get
===The get method (GET)===
The get method allow you to retrieve logs previously saved.  
This method takes a parameter which is the page of logs you intend to retrieve. it defaults to 1 when not specified.

For performance reason on your application, persiste. send only 12 logs per page. 

The following is an example of calling the get method 
{{{
<?php
$response=LogServiceClient::get(1);
var_dump($response);
}}}

===The delete method (DELETE)===
The delete method allow you to delete a log by specifying its id.  
Note that the log you want to delete must belong to the calling application otherwise you will get a failure status.

The following is an example of calling the delete method on a log with id (23) 
{{{
<?php
$response=LogServiceClient::delete(23);
var_dump($response);
}}}
