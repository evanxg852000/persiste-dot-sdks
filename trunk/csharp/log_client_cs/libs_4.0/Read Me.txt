For lower version of .net use the source code with the appropriate Json lib
in Json-libs/ folder.
The source code is designed to work for lower version of .net (3.0 is 
the minimu if you are using the json lib).
in order to support .net version lower than 3.0 you need to use another 
json lib as Linq is not supported in lower version
